# Denoising Autoencoder for MNIST dataset

This project is a convolution based autoencoder written in Python using Tensorflow that takes noisy images from MNIST dataset and performs noise removal to return denoised images. It uses high levelTensorflow API for designing, training, and testing of the network.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository or simply download it.

### Prerequisites
The project requires you to have python3, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib(for visualizing results) and an internet connection(to download the dataset for the first time). 

### Installing
Download Python from the Python website

pip install tensorflow
or, if you have a gpu
pip install tensorflow-gpu

pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib

## Deployment
Open terminal in the project folder. 
Use the following commands to run the training
